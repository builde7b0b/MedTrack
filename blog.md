8. Validated the application's startup and database operations through the logs.


## Summary
At this stage, we've laid the foundation for our MedTrack application.
We have set up the backend structure, defined the database schema, and implemented the necessary APIs for medications and suppliers.

### Misc
installed shellCheckin IntelliJ IDEA



# Day 2
## Day 2: Backend Development and Integration

- Continue developing the backend APIs for inventory transactions, including creating, updating, and retrieving transaction data.
- Implement integration with the database for seamless data storage and retrieval.
- Test the backend APIs using appropriate testing frameworks to ensure their functionality and reliability.


## DAY 2: Recap
1. Cucumber Testing with RestAssured
2. Database Errors with Server Connection - Solution: Switched to H2 DB
3. writing features and step definitions based on user stories
4. Defined API endpoints for CRUD operations on medications and suppliers.
5. Implemented the MedicationService class to handle the business logic for medications, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting medication records.
6. Implemented the SupplierService class to handle the business logic for suppliers, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting supplier records.
7. These services interact with the respective repository classes (MedicationRepository and SupplierRepository) for data access and persistence.
8. Tested all endpoints in post for medications, they are working.
